# Game Project 
A web game using a serverless architecture. 

## Gameplay
---
The game is a turn based, 1 versus all style game where one player controls a unique 'monster' and the rest play as a normal human. Each turn, a human or monster can take an action to help them win the game. Based on the role a player has, gameplay breaks down as follows 
### Playing as the monster
---
Players who play as the monster have access to unique abilities and mechanics. These abilities can range from short ranged teleportation, to 'siring' or turning a human player onto their side. Furthermore, the choice of monster affects certain game mechanics differently, such as a certain monster only being able to attack every 'other' turn, or a certain monster must defend on it's first encounter. <br>
Monster players can 'die' by losing all their health, but they respawn in a few turns. The only way monster players can lose the game is if the human players figure out what monster they are and fulfil the 'counter-mechanic'specific to that monster. 
#### Winning as the monster
----
To win as the monster, players will need to
- Kill all the human players 
- Fulfil a monster specific objective. 

### Playing as the humans 
---
Human players focus should be on gathering supplies and weapons through exploration and figuring out what monster they are up against. Each turn a human player can explore a nearby location, fight any creatures (including other players) within the location, or use an event / item card that gives them some benefit (or hinders them). If a human player 'dies' (loses all their health), they are out of the game for the rest of the game. 

#### Winning as the humans 
--- 
To win as humans , players must figure out which monster they are up against and preform the counter mechanic unique to that monster. 

## Monsters
---
All monster names are tenative to change 
### Mirror Monster 
--- 
A fast and agile monster. Their unique ability is to teleport to any location with a mirror. Mirrors can be found in any residential location such as houses and hotels. The mirror monster plays a lot like an assassin, focusing on human players that are away from the group and dealing massive single player damage. However, low health and defenses means that if more than one player is in the area, the mirror monster will fall quickly, without being able to confirm their kill. To defeat the mirror monster, human players must break all mirrors within the map, trapping the monster within their realm. 
### Demon Monster 
---
The demon monster is a strong, tough monster that must attack another player if they are in the same location as them. The demon monster has high health and respawns on the map faster than the other monsters. In order to defeat the demon monster, players must visit the church location, bless their weapons, and defeat the demon in battle.
